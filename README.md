# Asteroids

A 2D Newtonian gravity simulator. 

Specify the number of bodies and the strength (and sign) of the inverse-square force between them. Watch masses collide and orbits form!

### Parameters:
* *bodies* - the number of particles in the simulation
* *coupling* - the strength of the inverse-square force between particles.  Positive is attractive, negative is repulsive. 
* *walls* - particles will bounce elastically off of the walls 
* *C.O.M. frame* - view the simulation from the center-of-mass frame. 
* *pos. var* - adjust the variance in the Gaussian distribution of the particles' initial positions
